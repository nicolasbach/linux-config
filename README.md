# Linux Setup

Personal Configuration and Setup Script

Edit: Install script is untested since moving to neovim and hyprland. Also, waybar nor its config are getting installed at the moment. When I have time, I will fix the script and test it

This is a personal repository. The install script is only intended to work on baseline arch linux and nothing else.

The focus is, to keep track of all needed packages. The install script isn't tested on a new system!

# Dotfiles
 
Trying to keep track of all dotfiles to have a fast rollout if necessary


# Configs

Configurations for specific applications like alacritty or i3


# Packages
## Essentials
Essential packages needed for base system. Designed to work with custom .bashrc, that's why neofetch is in there

## Desktop Programs

Programs I need, when some sort of gui is installed. Basic stuff like a browser, mail etc


## Tools
cmdline Tools I occasionally use like nmap 


## i3 packages
all packages necessary to launch i3 window manager (can be switched in the future, also packages like rofi or flameshot will be needed regardless of the WM)

## hyprland_packages
packages necessary for my hyprland setup

## nvim_packages
packages necessary for my neovim setup


# Wallpapers
 Wallpapers are from [this](https://github.com/dharmx/walls/tree/main) Github-Repository. Just saving the ones I need in here to save time on re-searching my wallpapers in that repo
